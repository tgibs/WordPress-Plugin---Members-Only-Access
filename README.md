# WordPress Plugin - Members Only Access

The WordPress Plugin Members Only Access allows you to make your blog viewable only to visitors that are logged in. If a visitor is not logged in, they will be redirected to the WordPress login page. Once logged in they can be redirected back to the page that they originally requested.

## Usage

The Members Only Access plugin is ready to activate as-is.

1. Upload the `members_only_access.php` file into your `wp-content/plugins` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Log out and try to visit any other page than WordPress login page ;)
